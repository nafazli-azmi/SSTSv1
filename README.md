## MOTIVATION
Supervisors in general are to provide academic guidance and mentorship to their respective
students. Therefore, it is important to assign supervisors within the right clusters to ensure
every research or project produced with a high quality. Some supervisors may have many
students under their supervision. With different mode of studies for postgraduate student and
different projects for undergraduate student, supervisors could potentially lose track of their
students’ progress and thus could hinder the research or project goal. By having clear view of
the student’s progress, supervisor could harness the potential of their respective students.

## SYSTEM OBJECTIVES
1. To provide an effective tracking of lecturers within different clusters and the students’ research progress.
2. To provide a graphical representation of supervision numbers within the school.
3. To enable tracking of research topics currently executed among the research students.
4. To ease the communication between students and supervisor for supervision activities.
